This is a simple app that lets you combine multiple sensors into one device.
Group all sensors for rooms or zones to access all of the information in one device.
Average the Temperature, Humidity, and Illuminace of multiple sensors.
Group Locks, Contact, Motion, Water, Presence, and Sound Sensors to easily see which sensors are open,wet,active etc..Make virtual switches more useful.
* Use the virtual switch to enable/disable motion lighting rules with Google home - include contact,temperature, and humidity information within the virtual device for the ability to retrieve the information from Google home.  
                      *(Community Maintained Google Home Integration required)
                   
* Group your Nest Cameras to see if a person, sound, or motion is detected and which camera is active
                      *(Google SDM API - Nest integration required)

                   
 
When installing you must add the virtual device(s) using the "Virtual Multi Sensor Plus" Driver first
